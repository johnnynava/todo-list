Todo list I made from scratch with pure Javascript.
<br>
<br>
The application allows you to add new projects, delete projects, edit projects, add tasks to each project, deadlines, descriptions, etc.
<br>
<br>
It uses the Web Storage API (localStorage) to save information.

## Primary technologies used
• Javascript
<br>
• HTML
<br>
• CSS
<br>
• Web Storage API

## Other technologies/tools used
• Webpack
<br>
• Prettier
<br>
• ESLint

## Comments
• This is the one of the projects I consider to be one of my most challenging pure Javascript projects at the time. There's a lot of DOM Manipulation involved.
<br>
<br>
• The code is not the prettiest and now that I have more experience coding I would do many things differently.
<br>
<br>
• I made this before learning responsive design principles and how to code for that so this doesn't look good on mobile.
<br>
<br>
• There's no tests in place because I made this project before learning about TDD and other tools I now know how to use such as Jest.

Todo list in progress.

My most ambitious and time-consuming project to date I think. This took a while.

Still need to implement localStorage.

Note: look into either re-creating a list with values saved from LocalStorage or save the "List" object to a value in localStorage and then play with prototypes for subclasses (this is probably better)
